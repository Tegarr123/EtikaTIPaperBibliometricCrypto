In Indonesia, cryptocurrency has not been recognized as a legal currency, but is recognized as an investment alternative.

N2  - Countries in the world still do not have the same nature in compiling rules related to cryptocurrency, therfore it is very important to study the legality of using cryptocurrency as a means of payment in Indonesia. This paper aims to analyze the legal protection for the society related to the use of cryptocurrency as a payment. In particular cryptocurrency has two usability functions, namely as a medium of exchange and as a commodity. As a medium of exchange, cryptocurrency has currency characteristics because it can be accepted as a means of payment within a certain scope and its value is maintained because the number of issuance is limited. But the cryptocurrency is not a legitimate and official currency because it does not have the authority to issue and regulate, manage circulation and distribution, maintain its exchange value and all these functions are carried out by the computing system so that accountability is still doubtful.

N2  - Sentiment analysis is one part of Natural Language Processing (NLP), where the system can understand the form of text. Sentiment Analysis itself requires an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm. One of them is the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), which can assess positive or negative sentiment, especially when discussing "Cryptocurrency" and "Non-Fungible Token (NFT)" because in recent years. The discussion on these two topics has been widely discussed. On social media such as Twitter. In this study, a BERT model was created to assess sentiment analysis on "Cryptocurrency" and "NFT", by utilizing data crawling and pre-processing using Rapidminer (student version) with 86% accuracy and 87% precision. The results were obtained by selecting suitable hyperparameters such as learning rate 1e-7, epoch 5, and batch size 32. The results also increased from 2% accuracy to 3% precision. Further research needs to be done to improve the BERT model, not just an increase in the pre-processing part. In further research, the authors suggest combining several models or updating the pre-processing.

N2  - Stablecoins, as a form of innovation in the crypto asset ecosystem, have emerged as an attractive alternative in bridging the gap between fiat currencies and highly volatile crypto assets. In Indonesia, the presence of stablecoins has sparked debate about the need for strong regulations to mitigate risks and promote sustainable growth in the crypto asset industry. This journal outlines the urgency of stablecoin regulation on crypto assets in Indonesia. We analyze the possible implications of the presence of stablecoins without adequate regulation, including their potential impact on financial market stability, consumer protection, and national security. Additionally, we investigate regulatory approaches that the Indonesian government can take to create a conducive environment for the healthy growth of the crypto asset ecosystem while safeguarding the public interest. Through a multidisciplinary approach, we present arguments supporting the importance of developing a clear and sustainable regulatory framework for stablecoins in Indonesia. We also highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with these regulations and provide insight into how appropriate regulations can provide long-term benefits for the Indonesian economy. This research aims to provide a better understanding of the complexity of stablecoin regulation in the Indonesian context, while stimulating further discussion about the regulatory direction that should be taken in the face of rapid developments in the crypto asset industry.

N2  - The significant increase in crypto investment in Indonesia is very high. This is indicated by the increase in crypto transactions, especially bitcoin and the increasing number of member investors in Indodax as one of the crypto transaction platforms in Indonesia. However, this increase is not supported by laws and regulations that can protect investors against their funds that have been deposited on a crypto transaction platform due to platform errors or due to fraud that is rampant in the cryptocurrency world. The fairly high increase in investment has also attracted the attention of the Indonesian government in collecting income taxes for investors in the crypto world which can increase the government's coffers of wealth destined for national development. However, there is also no regulation that regulates how much and how the income tax will be imposed. imposed on investors. So tthe problem arises as to how legal protection is for crypto currency investors in Indonesia and how income taxes can be imposed on crypto investors. The problem approach used in this research is the statutory approach, and the conceptual approach. Legal protection for CryptoCurrency investors is in the form of supervision from BAPPEBTI, supervision from the Investment Supervisory Task Force, security protection from crypto asset market managers and law protection form UU ITE. The imposition of crypto taxes can be imposed as well as the final share income tax, which is 0.1% of the gross amount of crypto asset sales transactions.

N2  - Cryptocurrency has become a global phenomenon today. Based on the results of the GlobalWebIndex Survey, around 10% of internet users in Indonesia have digital currencies. This percentage makes Indonesia ranked as the 5th most cryptocurrency user in the world. The purpose of this research is to determine the risk and return on cryptocurrency investment. The methodology used in writing this article is a descriptive qualitative method with a normative approach. The data used by the author is secondary data that is public character such as abstracts, results of scientific publications, books, media and social networks that discuss about cryptocurrency. The results of the discussion of this article can be concluded that this type of cryptocurrency investment has a significant return, because cryptocurrency has entered the stock exchange, adopts digital technology, has a limited amount of supply, is anti-inflation, its security is protected by cryptography and its transaction costs are lower. . However, investing in cryptocurrency also carries a high level of risk. The risk and return of an investment have a linear relationship.

N2  - The speed of the adoption and use of cryptocurrency that utilizes blockchain technology as its central infrastructure is expanding globally, including in Indonesia. It has promising prospects as a future asset and payment instrument. However, the regulations in Indonesia are often delayed and inadequate for dealing with cryptocurrency's developments. This research is intended to analyze the approaches, regulations, and protection of the use of cryptocurrency. This study argues that the regulatory approach to using cryptocurrency is balanced, while Indonesia has a partial status in cryptocurrency legality. The government’s protection of cryptocurrency investors is adequate in using cryptocurrency as a commodity traded on futures exchanges with a license from Bappebti. A progressive policy for establishing the Digital Asset Law by the government is important due to the resultant clarity in the regulatory status of cryptocurrency will allow the ecosystem to grow and promote innovation, thus harnessing the benefits of cryptocurrency while mitigating related risks.

N2  - This research aims to discover the factors influencing Gen Z on investment decisions of cryptocurrency in Indonesia. Nowadays, cryptocurrency has become famous as most of Indonesian citizens interested to invest in cryptocurrency. Despite the fact that cryptocurrency fluctuates riskier than other instruments, many people still decide to invest in cryptocurrency, including Gen Z. The method used for this research is qualitative with semi-structured interviews conducted to collect data. Semi-structured interview provides more exploratory and inclusive answers from the respondents to support this research. This research contributes to giving more knowledge and insight particularly about the factors influencing the Gen Z on investment decision in cryptocurrency. The results of this research have shown many factors can influence people to decide investing in cryptocurrency, such as investing in cryptocurrency can generate more profit, 24-hour market, and its fame causing a sense of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) which are related to the Theory of Behavioral Finance. There are some other factors such as community with other investors, influencers in social media, and people around. Those factors are related to the Herding Theory where people are likely to follow other investors’ analysis rather than doing their own research and analysis. These findings propose that investors, especially Gen Z, should improve their self-control as well as investment analysis to decide their investments in cryptocurrency. Further research can explore other factors that may be influential by using quantitative method and by giving out questionnaires to reach out more respondents outside Jabodetabek or even outside Indonesia.

N2  - Cryptocurrency, an innovative asset class that is widely adopted by investors around the world. Indonesia is no exception to this, increasing the investor adoption up to 12 million investors in 2022. This number is very significant compared to Indonesia stock market investors that is only around 7 million investors. Various literatures have covered cryptocurrency in terms of pricing strategy and technicalities, so this paper extends the understanding of cryptocurrency dynamics from a behavioral finance perspective that is still less developed in Indonesia. This paper aims to explore the relationship between financial literacy, behavioral bias as well as its implication on the investment decision making process and investment performance from the perspective of investors based on Indonesia’s cryptocurrency investors at online communities. This paper used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to predict the relation between variables. Our results show that financial literacy has an impact on each behavioral bias. While the behavioral biases that investigate in this study have different result in term of impact on decision-making process and the investment performance. Overconfidence, herding and anchoring are the biases that significantly influence invertor’s decision making in scope of cryptocurrency market in Indonesia. This study outcome may help investors understand and increase the awareness of investor’s investment behavior and decision-making process, and parallel to that the regulators and other stakeholders may use the insight to improve investor’s protection.

N2  - Currently, the use of cryptocurrency has been increasingly popular around the globe. In fact, cryptocurrency became the special topic in the 2018 G20 Summit in Buenos Aires. Moreover, in 2021 El Salvador has become the first country in the world to declare Bitcoin as its legal medium of exchange other than US Dollar. In Indonesia the use of cryptocurrency is also growing rapidly. According to Indonesia Crypto Outlook Report 2020, there was a 2,263% increase of cryptocurrencies users from 2015 to 2020, with the total number of users in Indonesia reaching 1,547,329 persons. Based on this development, it is necessary to conduct research to observe what factors influence the use of cryptocurrency in Indonesia. Previous study about behavioral intention in the use of cryptocurrency found four influencing factors, which are performance expectancy, social influence, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions. This research aims to determine the influence of those four factors to behavioral intention to use cryptocurrency in Indonesia. It uses a quantitative approach with survey as its method. Furthermore, the data is analyzed using multiple linear regression techniques. Tests carried out included validity & reliability tests, normality tests, multicollinearity tests, heteroscedasticity tests, autocorrelation tests, F tests and t tests. The results of the study show that performance expectancy, social influence, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions have a significant effect on behavioral intention to use cryptocurrency.

N2  - Cryptocurrency, or crypto is an alternative medium of exchange. Cryptocurrencies are used with security, transparency and cost-effectiveness in mind. The purpose of this paper is to analyze cryptocurrencies. In this study, the methodology used is a qualitative descriptive approach. The object of this research is cryptocurrency. The data is secondary data obtained from journal articles on the database of reputable journal websites. Regarding the characteristics of money, cryptocurrencies are acceptable, but from an economic perspective, cryptocurrencies do not fully meet the characteristics of currencies due to high price volatility. Research findings are based on journal articles. Further discussion regarding the viewpoint of Islamic economics will be a good input to enrich the research.

N2  - Cryptocurrency is a blockchain-based technology that is being used for any activity so that it has the potential to increase state revenue, primarily from taxation. This study aims to measure what kind of tax policy can be applied to cryptocurrencies in Indonesia. This research uses a descriptive qualitative method using secondary data. Secondary data was obtained through journals, books, and tax laws. Based on this research, cryptocurrencies can be subject to income tax and value-added tax. However, the imposition of VAT is not very potent. This is because cryptocurrencies in Indonesia are more often an investment instrument. VAT can be charged if cryptocurrency is legalized as a legal tender in Indonesia. Therefore, the current tax policy on cryptocurrencies in Indonesia is more appropriate to use the income tax.

N2  - Cryptocurrency investment is currently expanding quickly on a global scale as well as in Indonesia. On the one hand, cryptocurrency can be used as a medium of exchange or a form of money, which represents the original purpose of cryptocurrency. On the other hand, it can also be used as a commodity or as digital assets, also known as crypto assets. Cryptocurrency is illegal to use as money in Indonesia, but it is legal to exchange it as an asset. This study explores the legal protections for holders of collateral against the loss of crypto assets as well as how crypto assets are governed by material guarantees in Indonesia. A conceptual and statutory approach, technical analysis, and a normative legal research methodology were applied in the study. The legal material was analyzed by using the content analysis approach, which involved examining the content and legality of the material gleaned from various laws and regulations by looking at the relevant legal precedents. The discussion results discover that crypto assets fall under the definition of "intangible movable objects" as defined in article 503 BW. In addition, crypto assets had material rights in the form of material guarantees in the form of a pledge and fiduciary guarantees, allowing the parties to carry out their agreements in good faith even in the event that the collateral object is lost. These disputes could be settled through either non-litigation or litigation.

N2  - Indonesia is a densely populated country with a population of 260 million, making Indonesia the fourth most populous country in the world. The continued rapid development of the economy in Indonesia has made land an asset that provides benefits. In Indonesia, land ownership that has the highest legal power is proven by a Certificate of Ownership or in indonesian is called as Sertifikat Hak Milik (SHM). Meanwhile, the land titling process is often complex and lengthy, and because of the processing carried out by government agencies in handling a variety of different documents, some structured people commit fraud. The impact is that the model currently used does not have good governance. This research offers a Blockchain-based solution in providing data harmony and openness, lightening in data access, permanent records management, and most importantly it is a solution that is cheaper and faster. This research offers a step-by-step model of Blockchain selection beginning from the public Blockchain ledger which will continuously incorporate two degrees of Hybrid Blockchain.

Research about cryptocurrency in Indonesia still focused on the legal or religious status of its investment. This descriptive-quantitative research aim is to describe the return and the risk of cryptocurrency investment. Therefore, we use the descriptive analysis and the GARCH (1,1) model to the return data of 15 cryptocurrencies with the largest market value. Most of these cryptocurrencies can yield a higher return when compared with the return of the foreign exchange and stock market return. Despite this benefit, they exhibit higher risks and volatility clustering or heteroscedasticity. Further research should be done to reveal more properties of their return and performance in portfolio.

N2  - Financial stability is the problem that correlated with many aspects. In this digital era, virtual currency has emerged as one of financial assets. Fluctuation from cryptocurrencies price made an impact into financial stability indirectly. It has been proved by the market capitalization of publicly traded cryptocurrencies in 2019 reach USD 240 billion. The percentages reach 66% for the market capitalization. Three highest cryptocurrencies uphold are Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP. This condition made these three cryptocurrencies become the important investment products. However, cryptocurrency is the product with high volatility. Because of that, this study aims to monitor financial stability from cryptocurrencies prediction using artificial intelligent algorithm. This research copes the problem by predicting bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP using three different intelligent algorithms, which are K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). By this prediction had been figured out about up and down value of cryptocurrencies using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate stabilization of finance. Accuration system with LSTM shown that the price of cryptocurrency will fit with the data actual using LSTM, in which the accuracy around 80%. This condition meant that LSTM had been succeeded to proposed as algorithm that could fit the cryptocurrencies value. It could strengthen usability to indicate financial stability refer into cryptocurrencies price.

N2  - This research aims to analyze the position of cryptocurrencies according to positive law in Indonesia and legal protection of investors who invest in cryptocurrency in Indonesia. The results of this study indicate that, First, the position of cryptocurrency in Indonesia based on positive law in Indonesia is that it cannot be used as a legal tender in Indonesia as stipulated in Article 21 paragraph (1) of Law No. 7 of 2011 concerning Currencies, which states that payment instruments that must be used and legally recognized in the Republic of Indonesia only use Rupiah. This is also confirmed by PBI 18/40/PBI/2016 on the Implementation of Payment Transaction Processing and in PBI 19/12/PBI/2017 on the Implementation of Financial Technology. However, cryptocurrency can be used as an investment instrument as regulated in Law No. 10 of 2011 concerning Amendments to Law No. 32 of 1997 concerning Commodity Futures Trading. Second, legal protection for cryptocurrency investors is preventively regulated in the Trade Law and Consumer Protection Law, which emphasizes that trading activities using electronic systems are required to provide complete and correct data and / or information. Furthermore, e-commercial activities are protected by the ITE Law. Then repressively, dispute resolution in cryptocurrency transactions is regulated in Article 22 of PerBappebti No. 5 of 2019 concerning Technical Provisions for the Implementation of the Crypto Asset Physical Market on the Futures Exchange, that dispute resolution is carried out by deliberation to reach consensus, if it does not reach consensus, if it does not reach consensus, the parties can settle through the Commodity Futures Trading Arbitration Agency (BAKTI) and the District Court as stated in the agreement between the parties.

N2  - Bank Indonesia has the desire to create a digital representation of money which is a symbol of its country's sovereignty called the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). However, CBDC also presents risks, especially inthe legal aspects in Indonesia. The purpose of this paper is to complement the shortcomings of previous studies by carefully examining how ideally the governance and implementation of CBDC is in Indonesia, in the ius costituendum frame. The method used isnormative juridical which is qualitative in nature based on library research. Data sources come from secondary data sources and tertiary data. The data were analyzed using a deductive mindset with descriptive and analytical methods. The results of the study are that the implementation of CBDC requires governance in the field of law, technology infrastructure readiness and community readiness as well as governance regarding the supervision and stability of CBDC values in Indonesi. An important conclusion from this study is the need for a legal product that regulates the implementation and protection of the community in the use of CDBC in Indonesia.

N2  - Cryptocurrency is a type of virtual currency that works similarly to real money and enables users to virtually send payments for transactions involving business. With the development of crypto assets today, several pawn and loan institutions accept crypto assets as collateral objects. In the case of pawning, default can also occur which requires that the collateral from the debtor be confiscated in the event of default. The purpose of this study is to determine the legal strength of crypto assets used as collateral objects and to find out the execution mechanism for crypto asset confiscation in Indonesia in the event of default. This study used a normative juridical research method for its research. The type of information used in this study is secondary information, specifically information found through library research. The result of this research is that crypto assets can be used as collateral objects, but not as main collateral. Crypto assets as collateral objects already have strong legal force, this is based on Book II of the Civil Code, Law no. 10 of 2011 concerning Amendments to Law Number 32 of 1997 concerning Commodity Futures Trading, Regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency Number 5 of 2019 concerning Technical Provisions for the Implementation of the Physical Crypto Asset Market on the Futures Exchange. In terms of regulating the confiscation of crypto assets, it can be said that currently in Indonesia itself there are no special regulations and special institutions that regulate the confiscation of crypto assets. But the process of confiscation of crypto assets can be carried out with procedures such as foreclosure of other material guarantees.

N2  - Bitcoin and Altcoin are digital currencies (cryptocurrencies) that use blockchain technology, a technology that can monitor, supervise, record, and record every transaction that occurs in digital currency. Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning it is spread everywhere, not centralized and cannot be regulated by authorities or other institutions. In making transactions, it is very necessary to recognize digital currencies such as identity, core business, projects being developed, volume of demand and supply, and other indicators. The need to find out information about coins/crypto tokens before trading, is a very helpful thing for traders because of concerns about coins/tokens that are indicated as scam or rugpull. Coinmarketcap.com and coingecko are data provider sites related to bitcoin and altcoins around the world, which can help find and analyze related information about tokens/cryptocoins to be traded, but do not guarantee accuracy, but can minimize the occurrence of greater losses. Digital currencies provide business opportunities and loopholes to be able to generate profit from every coin/token traded, but on the other hand these assets are risky for traders and investors due to their high volatility which makes market price movements difficult to predict (unpredictable). To be able to overcome this problem it is necessary to manage finances by taking 10% for trading from the main salary earned, dividing which assets are needed for trading and which are for daily / other living needs and self-control well, when is it time to trade, rest, and when to pause. That way it can save other assets when the other asset is experiencing a decline, so it doesn't disturb the main asset.

N2  - All industries, including banking, will be impacted by the development of information technology. The creation of cryptocurrency, also known as virtual currency or digital currency, is a result of the advancement of financial technology. On the internet, the usage of digital currencies as a form of payment started to spread. This currency is intended to make payments more convenient and secure. Using blockchain technology, it lowers the cost of transactions. However, because it hurts Indonesia's financial system, monetary stability, and payment system, the government, in this case, Bank Indonesia, forbids transactions using digital or virtual currency. The influence of cryptocurrencies on the Indonesian economy and the government's position on the country's current technology are both explained in this paper. In terms of the technology provided, cryptocurrencies are a development in financial technology that will enable future financial transactions to convert paper money into digital money. To prevent future legislation from outlawing the technology found in cryptocurrencies and to help the general public better comprehend cryptocurrencies, it is desired that the government would examine the technology in cryptocurrencies more thoroughly.

N2  - This paper investigates the characteristics of crypto-asset investors in Indonesia and the key factors affecting their investment decision. The authors apply the Probit model on a dataset of Indonesian equity investors collected through a primary survey. This study complements and extends the current literature of financial literacy and investment decision by providing country-specific evidence of Indonesia. Our results suggest that younger Indonesian males with higher risk tolerance and who have some previous experiences in equity investing are more likely to invest in crypto assets. In contrast, we found no significant evidence that higher financial literacy and higher income increase the likelihood to invest in crypto assets. In addition, we conclude that most crypto asset investors in Indonesia are risk-loving investors driven mainly by profit-seeking motives and willing to accept higher risk. The study sheds light on the interplay of owners' characteristics, financial literacy, risk tolerance, and how they affect investing behaviors. This study would assist the Indonesian Financial Services Authority in better regulate crypto assets investing and focus on which type of investors need to be provided with more financial education regarding the risk and return of their investment type. The second implication is that the information obtained from this research can be used by firms, brokerage, and dealers providing investment services to target better the type of investors who would be more likely to invest in crypto assets

N2  - Despite this promising potential, it is important to remember that investing in Bitcoin also involves risk. The price of Bitcoin is very volatile, and its value can change dramatically in a short amount of time. In addition, regulations regarding cryptocurrencies are still unclear in many countries, and regulatory changes could affect the price and adoption of Bitcoin. Security is also an important factor, as Bitcoin can be vulnerable to cyberattacks and theft. This study aimed to conduct studies related to the potential of bitcoin cryptocurrency as an asset for future investment as well as the potential risks that exist in this asset. Literature search efforts are carried out by searching on search engines using certain keywords. Articles that match the inclusion criteria are reviewed in depth. Bitcoin's potential as a future investment alternative is highly dependent on factors such as value growth, institutional adoption, and developments in blockchain technology. Nonetheless, it is important to be aware of the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies and to carry out in-depth research and consulting before making any investment decisions.

N2  - Cryptocurrency started its boom in Indonesia in 2013 and ever since, its popularity has been soared in the community, especially among younger generations. Most enthusiasts agree that it is a captivating investment instrument due to its high return in the past years. The covid-19 pandemic strike, which led to the series of lockdowns, played a major role in echoing the digital asset's popularity. The rapid growth of the asset's adoption invites questions of regulatory necessity and the role of related regulators. This writing addresses those questions and, in the end, this paper finds that the regulators need to identify the economic problems arising with the existence of the crypto assets and regulate sufficiently to ensure the innovation is not halted due to overregulation. This writing uses a juridical-normative research method with a case approach. Regulations made by the Government as the regulator are needed in order to realize protection, legal certainty and harmony in regulating investment activities and payments with cryptocurrency.

N2  - In the era of digital economic development, blockchain and crypto asset innovations have gained wide acceptance and skyrocketing worldwide demand. Behind the emergence of popular crypto assets, the mechanism of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is used to issue this new form of currency. An ICO is highly favoured because of its efficiency, minimum underwriting requirements, high profits, and liquidity. Without exception, the hype accompanying ICOs has also influenced the Indonesian public. There remains, however, very minimal protection for investors who participate in ICOs that are being held in Indonesia. There are many disadvantages to an ICO, including high risks for investors, its vulnerability to fraud or crime, and the lack of regulation regarding the mechanism of ICOs. Furthermore, ICOs are very much intertwined with the development of decentralised finance (DeFi), one of the latest crypto-related financial innovations. DeFi likewise poses various risks and threats to the traditional financial system that needs to be monitored from the beginning of the ICO process. Therefore, by using normative research methods based on literature studies, this study aims to comprehensively explain the problems of ICO investor protection in Indonesia and the solutions for overcoming these problems

N2  - Data, reports, and information show that cryptocurrency has supported certain parties as a convenience, whereas the purpose of cryptocurrency is to minimize the weaknesses of conventional money systems in international relations in the current era of globalization. Countries that cannot represent or apply autonomous law in facing cryptocurrency challenges, because it is feared it is increasingly difficult to overcome global cryptocurrency crime. It is precisely in eradicating cryptocurrency crime, law enforcement authorities, priorities of prosecutors who have the highest supremacy in the field of prosecution and other discretion in law enforcement must be dynamic in law enforcement against facilitators from responses to social needs and aspirations, in accordance with legal considerations must acknowledge the wishes of the community and agree in achieving substantive justice. Considering that virtual currency has been banned in Indonesia but crypto-asset trading on the futures exchange has been in force, responsive discretionary prosecutions are needed in combating cryptocurrency crime in Indonesia. Liability that exceeds liability based on faults, namely strict liability, vicarious liability, and secondary liability to any parties that cause cryptocurrency crime can be applied to the mechanism of "follow the money" and "trace the information and communication technologies (ICTs) footprint". It is hoped that prosecution discretion by the prosecutor can reach to the monitoring of suspicious "nodes" and monitoring the registration of ICTs that are vulnerable to cryptocurrency crimes, such as laptops, cellphones, computers, and SIM cards, in providing a deterrent effect to the perpetrators of cryptocurrency crime.

N2  - When the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has an impact on reducing world economic growth, this condition gives benefits to the digital investment sector, one of which is the increase in crypto asset trading. The crypto asset trading sector is a digital commodity that is in great demand and is growing rapidly in society. This is because crypto asset trading does not require each investor to meet each other face to face and only requires an internet network in transactions. Throughout 2021, crypto asset trading and the number of investors who transacted almost all over the world continued to experience a significant increase, including in Indonesia. However, at the beginning of 2022, there was a conflict between Russia-Ukraine which affected the increase in commodity prices around the world. This condition then triggered inflation in several major countries, which in turn resulted in the threat of a global economic recession. This phenomenon then leads to a weakening global economy which can hinder the growth of crypto asset trading in the future. Not only that, crypto asset trading itself is also still haunted by concerns about the weak security system in investing in crypto assets which is vulnerable to the rise of various fraud cases. Therefore, regulation and facilities that are following the current needs of crypto asset trading are urgently needed to stimulate the growth of crypto assets. Actions taken by the government through the establishment of crypto asset trading regulations and supporting platforms are very important to provide business certainty and security in investing in crypto assets in Indonesia

N2  - The need for financial transactions in the virtual world that continues to grow demands an increase in the speed, quality, and quantity of various innovations and discoveries in the field of financial technology known as cryptocurrency. This discovery encourages various developments of the virtual world economy which is increasingly diverse and growing according to the needs and interests of existing economic actors. Cryptocurrencies are currently only considered as digital assets that can be traded so they are not recognized as a means of payment. However, cryptocurrency trading in Indonesia is a fast-growing field, so its economic value continues to rise rapidly. This encourages the emergence of crypto mining businesses that tend to use large amounts of electricity. The issue of carbon footprint in cryto mining has in several ways been the cause of the prohibition of this activity. In Indonesia, this activity is still not banned, in 2022 a carbon tax will be applied where every kilogram of carbon equivalent emissions that exceed a certain cap will be subjected to Rp-30 (0.21 cent dollar) tax. So the paper tries to analyze the extent to which this carbon tax will affect crypto mining in Indonesia and how the mitigation of crypto mining's carbon footprint can be managed through proper regulation without disturbing the crypto economic sector that is blooming in Indonesia.

This was normative juridical research. Since this type of research was doctrinal, normative legal research was more oriented to the practical aspect. From a juridical point of view, the approach was based on legal principles and then analyzed. The research data was obtained from previous research, journals, official websites, and relevant laws and regulations in Indonesia. Based on the results of the analysis related to investment activities using cryptocurrencies, in terms of Law No. 19 of 2016 which is a revision of Law No. 11 of 2008 concerning electronic information and transactions, legal problems often arise when there is information, communication and electronic transactions. As a regulator, the state has a role in consumer supervision and protection. Through the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (BAPPEBTI), Bank Indonesia seek to have every cryptocurrency exchange registered so that it can trade the cryptocurrency assets. The mechanism for imposing cryptocurrency taxes or on trading cryptocurrency assets was by appointing a third party as a VAT collector for trading cryptocurrency assets. Cryptocurrency exchange was carried out by imposing VAT and income taxes and was combined with trading fees. So, the total deduction was 0.31% with the details, 0.1% trading fee added with VAT & 0.21% income tax.

N2  - The emergence of COVID-19 in December 2019 in China, until it spread to Indonesia in early March 2020 was designated as the center of the transmission of COVID-19. It negatively impacted the financial sector and caused cryptocurrency volatility to increase significantly. Therefore, the purpose of this study is essential to determine the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the method of estimating the price of cryptocurrencies. This shows that cryptocurrency fluctuations are unstable and irregular compared to equities, so the cryptocurrency market is more risky and difficult to predict during the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the salient factors that influence Indonesian cryptocurrency owners in making their investment decision. This study employs intergroup bias, subjective norms, overborrowing, and spending control to explain cryptocurrency investment behavior. The questionnaire was collected from 309 respondents from the five largest internet user areas: Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Semarang, and Medan. This study executes the research framework using binary logistic regression. The results reveal that intergroup bias and overborrowing are the most impulsive factors contributing to the cryptocurrency investment decisions over the past year. Furthermore, after November 2021, Indonesian crypto owners are more irrational in a bearish period since their investment decisions are driven by their desire to be accepted in the social group. Moreover, when they have overindebtedness, instead of solving their debt problems, they prefer to spend their money on cryptocurrency investments. The subjective norms’ influencers suggest that crypto owners not invest when the cryptocurrency price is sharply declining. The findings contribute to the dual-systems perspective and social contagion theories, enriching the empirical study regarding investment behavior.

N2  - This study aims to determine whether crypto assets are suitable as an alternative investment when compared to the performance of the LQ 45 stock index, 10-year Indonesian Government Bonds, and Antam's precious metal in the form of gold. The measurement of the performance of an investment is not only seen from the rate of return but also needs to pay attention to the risks to be borne, then the performance measurement is used using the Sharpe, Treynor, and Jensen measurement methods. The three models base their analysis on past rates of return to determine the compensation for the returns obtained for each measure of risk borne. This study used descriptive analysis with case study methods, while hypothesis testing was carried out by nonparametric statistical tests using Kruskal-Wallis H because there were more than two independent variables. The values of the Sharpe Index and Jensen Index show that Bitcoin investment instruments are the highest-performing instruments while the LQ45 stock index is the lowest. The conclusion of this study shows that there is no significant difference between investment performance using the Sharpe method, while in the Treynor and Jensen methods, there are significant differences.

N2  - This article aims to analyze the use of cryptocurrency as a substitute for conventional currency in Indonesia. The article is written using normative legal research methods with conceptual and legislative approaches. The results of this research indicate that cryptocurrency can be considered as a solution for a different level of payment system; however, the demand for this type of cryptocurrency is not proportionate to its supply. As a result, cryptocurrency is unlikely to become an everyday payment tool but may serve as a more specific means of payment or exchange at a certain level. Currently, cryptocurrency can only function as an investment tool that is bought and sold, making it challenging when directly compared to traditional currency for daily payment purposes. The opportunity for cryptocurrency to replace conventional currency in Indonesia is very small. This is due to the unstable (highly fluctuating) value of cryptocurrency and the absence of an authority determining its value.

N2  - The utilization of Information Technology, media, and communication has changed both the behaviour of society and human civilization globally. And the role of the law is to regulate social life. At the same time, the digital world provides unlimited space and time for its users. One of the digital developments is related to cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is guarded by a cryptographic security system. Crypto money can generally be used to buy various kinds of digital goods. The prices and characteristics of cryptocurrencies vary widely, depending on the type. What is a cryptocurrency, and what are the risks of owning this type of money in Indonesia? One of the uses of owning a cryptocurrency is for investment. Currently, the development of cryptocurrencies in Indonesia is swift. Generally, people from the upper-middle class already know about the term. The same thing happened in the international market. The question now is, what about the regulatory side, is cryptocurrency legal to use in Indonesia? With the background of the increasingly rapid development of this cryptocurrency in the community, both in terms of growth and the obstacles and constraints found, the authors conducted a study with the theme "Corporate responsibility for digital business crimes? Where is the background that the regulations that cover it are not clear (the ITE Law has not yet been formed to answer the above problems)?, and it is technically challenging to identify the role of each party in the current digital business in Indonesia and the existence of a knowledge gap between consumers and producers.

N2  - The development of crypto assets in Indonesia has been high-speed. However, its regulations are still ambiguous, sectoral, and not comprehensive. Crypto assets currently are only recognized as commodities for trading and investment, even though the types and applications are very diverse. The Indonesian government uses a combination of two policy approaches in crypto asset regulation, The Balanced/Risk-Proportionate Approach and The Restrictive Approach. Both approaches have some drawbacks and lead to regulatory arbitrage. The main cause of this problem is the need for a crypto asset taxonomy agreed upon by all parties. Based on the Cost-Benefit Analysis, a more appropriate policy approach is a comprehensive regulatory framework. For this reason, two things are recommended: 1) Ministry of Trade through Trade Policy Agency needs to conduct a thorough evaluation of regulations related to crypto asset trading, and 2) Ministry of Trade through CoFTRA coordinate with BI, OJK, and related stakeholders to create a crypto asset taxonomy. With these two recommendations, comprehensive, adaptive, and accommodative regulations will be produced, which will create an innovative, productive blockchain ecosystem and contribute to Indonesia's development.

N2  - Safe-haven assets conserve their value or grow against another asset or portfolio during market turmoil. Indonesian stock market, represented by the Jakarta composite index (JKSE), plunged in price because of COVID-19, pushing investors to look for safe-havens. The cryptocurrency began to be perceived as a store of value as indicated by the transaction volume increase; hence it was expected to be a safe haven asset. However, cryptocurrency’s high price volatility cast doubts on its store of value effectiveness, prompting inspection for its safe haven property as well. This research aimed to predict the assets' risk and return plus investigate whether cryptocurrency is safe haven assets against the Indonesian stock market during COVID-19. Daily closing prices of JKSE, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple were used, then the GARCH model was implemented in the forecasting. DCC-GARCH model, followed by dummy variable regression, will be applied to the return data to evaluate the safe haven property. The prediction projected Bitcoin as the most profitable asset and Ripple as the riskiest. The analysis and robustness test suggested that none of these cryptocurrencies were safe haven assets during the whole observation. This indicates that investors who intend to seek safe haven investments were advised against investing in these cryptocurrencies

N2  - Technological advances require the whole world to participate in its development, especially cryptocurrencies that are happening all over the world. Bitcoin virtual currency is an exceptional virtual currency. Indonesia still lacks clear rules about the legal basis that bridges the existence of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. So far, Cryptocurrency as a payment in Indonesia is prohibited and only allowed as a commodity. However, there are no binding regulations in this regard. The data collection and analysis method in this research uses the literature search analysis method that aligns with the latest phenomena related to Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The primary legal source is the Law, and the other is the Law. The problem in this research is finding out the legality and legal action for cryptocurrency users in Indonesia. Based on this research, Bitcoin cryptocurrency positioning in Indonesia is defined solely as a trading subject regulated by Law Number 5 of 2019 concerning Technical Provisions for the Implementation of the Physical Crypto Asset Market. From this, we can conclude whether the Indonesian state has not allowed the circulation of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency as a virtual currency or a means of payment in Indonesia. However, the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (BAPPEBTI) Regulation No. 5 of 2019 concerning Technical Regulations for the Management of the Physical Market for Crypto Assets on the Futures Exchange describes Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency as a commodity or investment in Indonesia.
